## VIEW OF PROCESS TEAM

The Process Team will be responsible for leading Shambhala forward during a time of organizational, ethical, and financial crisis through a process of listening, exploration, and resolution. The work of the PT will be a unique creative process. Enriched by the valuable input we have received from people both inside and outside of Shambhala, the Task Force will recommend that the Process Team engage the community in a process that results in community healing, culture change, and a governance structure relevant for Shambhala in these times and for the future.

## THE JOB OF THE PROCESS TEAM

The Process Team is charged with the task of creating a path to freshness, trust, and transparency for Shambhala as a worldwide organization that adheres to the vision of Shambhala, the lineage of Sakyongs, and the Shambhala teachings, including Mahayana and Vajrayana buddhadharma. The work of the Process Team will address community healing, community building, social system dynamics, and a review of governance in the Shambhala through three main pathways of exploration. These are:

1\. Community Healing and Learning \
2\. Cultural change in Shambhala \
3\. New governance structures/Organizational Development

1\. Community Healing and Learning. We have heard from many people that healing is an important part of moving forward, and acknowledging problems that are present is the first step to healing.The PT will hold as an essential aspect the healing process for the Shambhala community. This might include listening, truth & reconciliation regarding sexual harms and power abuse, addressing trauma, and assessing what people need to continue with full engagement and heart. An Olive Branch is already a resource in this regard. 

2\. Cultural Change in Shambhala. Shambhala hosts broad and diverse cultures and lifestyles. Culture change might include an assessment of Shambhala culture that would lead to a path of growth at all levels of the organization. Shambhala requires change in order to remain true to the heart of Shambhala vision. Among other aspects, culture change fosters education and raising awareness regarding social system dynamics (i.e., patriarchy, choice in maintaining real estate assets over investing in human resources, racism, north american centrism, classism, heterosexism, cis-sexism, and able bodyism, etc). The integration of this kind of awareness is important to any process of culture change, especially as we create new models for governance.

3\. New Governance Structures/Organizational Development. The PT will explore what it means to manifest the vision of Shambhala and the teachings of our lineage as a worldwide organization. There are no set parameters for this exploration. The PT will gather input from the community toward the design of a model for the organization, which includes spiritual leadership and organizational leadership. Tasks are likely to include research, design, and prototypes inspired by the vision of Shambhala and relevant for these times. It is recommended that the  PT also look to the teachings of the Dorje Drad√ºl on leadership, wealth, and power and, at the same time, maintain a sense of revolutionary change.

This work will be supported by the Interim Board, as needed, in terms of input, review, and feedback.

## QUALITIES OF PROCESS TEAM APPLICANTS

Given the three key pathways of the Process Team, the combined membership will require a variety of skills and expertise. Overall qualities sought for PT members are the same as those for the Interim Board, which include commitment to the Shambhala vision of basic goodness and the lineage of enlightened society; ability and willingness to listen; open-minded without bias or fixed agenda; willingness and ability to evoke new ideas from the community; ability to collaborate with others (team player); ability to be innovative and draw ideas from different systems and processes - willingness to experiment; and an entrepreneurial spirit.** **

We are looking for a broad range of applicants: Of different ages, geographically diverse, diverse social identities, students of either or both Sakyongs, and/or friends of Shambhala, who have the necessary qualities, qualifications, and expertise.

## Responsibilities and Time Commitment for the PT

The Process Team will listen to the community, receive feedback, and oversee the deeper and longer process for healing and inviting a new approach to community involvement in Shambhala leadership. Being a member of the PT is a volunteer appointment. There is no pre-established term for the PT as the work may take longer than a year. We also anticipate that the time commitment of PT members will vary. The PT will be encouraged to invite others in the community to assist and participate in the process of healing, re-assessing and re-envisioning. We encourage the PT to avail themselves of the wisdom and experience that are already in the community and in local centers and groups. 

**Number of Process Team Members**: Not as yet determined.

**Review Process**: All candidates will go through the same defined review process. This will determine who will be interviewed and finally appointed.
