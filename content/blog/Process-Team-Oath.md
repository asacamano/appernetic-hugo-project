Calling upon the lineages and dralas of Buddhadharma and Shambhala warriorship to support me in this
oath, I, [name], as a member of the Shambhala Process Team, pledge to work diligently to further the
vision of enlightened society and basic goodness.

I further pledge to:

* apply gentleness, fearlessness, and intelligence in all my activities on the Process Team.
* continue my own practice and study while I serve.
* faithfully represent the wisdom of the lineage, the teachings, and the community as I understand it.
* refrain from using this position for personal gain.

If I am unable to fulfil these pledges, I request that I be removed from the Process Team.
