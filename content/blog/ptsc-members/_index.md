# Members of the Process Team Steering Committee

*Please forgive the absense of biographies for all members - we're working on fixing that.*

{{< member title="Jim Fladmark" src="jim-fladmark-headshot.png" >}}
Jim grew up on a small farm in South Dakota, the third of eleven children, and moved to Colorado in 1980. Since 1985 he has continuously worked in Shambhala, holding core staff positions at Shambhala Mountain Center, Naropa University, and Marpa House. Most recently he was the Director of Practice and Education at the Boulder Shambhala Center from 2008-2018. 

Jim is motivated by the vision of Shambhala, especially how Shambhala governance and culture aspires to offer a global alternative to care for our earth and all beings. He has been a practitioner for over thirty years and has tried to apply practice to daily life. In childhood he learned to play the piano and in 2016 began writing songs to share his experience of current events and living life. Jim also has an artistic passion for creating sacred environments, trusting the unfolding process of starts and stops to connect to the magic and blessings of life.
