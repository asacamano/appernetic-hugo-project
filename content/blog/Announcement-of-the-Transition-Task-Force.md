What follows is excepted from the July 30 email by the Kalapa Council to the Shambhala Community. The full text is available online [here](../translations/English/EN - 7-30-18 - Transition Announcement.pdf).

***

To separate current Kalapa Council members and the Sakyong from the appointment of the next board, a Transition Task Force team will be implemented to select and appoint Shambhala's next Interim Board of Directors while the Sakyong has stepped back from teaching and administrative duties. The Transition Task Force, which will consist of several respected leaders from our international community, will not have any legal or fiduciary responsibilities for Shambhala.

This Transition Task Force has two tasks:

**1\. Select and appoint an Interim Board.**

Within six weeks of being seated, the Transition Task Force will appoint an Interim Board of Directors to serve for a period of one year. Current Kalapa Council leadership will maintain their legal board roles until the Interim Board is appointed by the task force, at which point they will transition fiduciary and legal responsibility to the Interim Board. Please see below for a timeline.

**2\. Select and appoint a Process Team.**

Working in tandem with the Interim Board, the Process Team will develop a process which will allow future leadership, representation, and governance to be improved. This team will be comprised of sangha members skilled in process, governance, and facilitation methodologies. The Process Team will listen to the community, take feedback, and guide a process to oversee the deeper and longer process of inviting a new approach to community leadership in Shambhala.

**Transition Task Force Members:**

Ani Pema Chödrön, Acharya\
Arawana Hayashi, Acharya\
Charlene Leung, Acharya\
Suzann Duquette, Acharya\
Debbie Coats, Dapön and Interim European Governing Body Member\
Katrin Stelzel, Interim European Governing Body Member\
