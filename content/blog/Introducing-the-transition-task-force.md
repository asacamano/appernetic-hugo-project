Dear Shambhala Community,

The Transition Task Force held its first Zoom meeting, Wednesday, August 1. While we are just starting our work together and have many unanswered questions, we are writing to you now because transparency and community involvement is important to us. We are in the process of setting up a website and intend to be in weekly communication with you as our work progresses. The following is a preview of who we are and what we will do.  We will send out a more detailed introductory letter next week.

Who We Are

The Transition Task Force is a group of seven people with one facilitator who are responsible for appointing a one-year Interim Board and Process Team for Shambhala. Debbie Coats, an original Task Force appointee, has decided to recuse herself. Debbie explained her decision in this way:

In view of the allegations circulating on social media and the negativity that this is generating towards myself and also towards the task force I am recusing myself from the group with immediate effect. I feel that relating to the allegations is distracting me from the work that is needed and is also obstructing the work of the task force.

Acharya Pema Chödrön's role on the Transition Task Force is to make recommendations for and participate in the final selection of the Interim Board and Process Team members. Ani Pema also will be available for other key issues and decisions that may arise.

More personal introductory information on each of us will come in our next letter.

In brief, our task is two-fold:

1\. To Select and Appoint an Interim Board to serve for 1 year. The Interim Board will assume all legal and fiduciary responsibilities previously held by the Kalapa Council for Shambhala USA and Shambhala Canada. Shambhala Europe has a different legal structure, and it is currently in transition from the previous governance structure.

2\. To Select and Appoint a Process Team. Working in tandem with the Interim Board, the Process Team will work with the community to develop an appropriate and healthy governance structure for Shambhala world-wide.

The selection process will include input and recommendations received from the community.

What We Are Not:

- We are not a board.\
- We are not a replacement group for the Kalapa Council.\
- We are not a leadership group.\
- We are not responsible for governance.\
- We are not responsible for developing a new governance structure.

What We Will Do:

The Task Force has a six-week appointment. During this time, we will:

- Develop methods for receiving and evaluating community-wide input and recommendations for Interim Board and Process Team members.\
- Meet at least once a week as a group.\
- Join in sub-committee meetings and work throughout the week.\
- Provide a forum or forums for communication and input.\
- Send weekly updates to the community and post our weekly meeting minutes.\
- Appoint members of a one-year Interim Board.\
- Appoint Process Team members

With answers to a few more questions, we will proceed to share next steps, which will include recommendations for initial criteria and desired qualifications for Interim Board and Process Team applicants and the process for making your recommendations.

We have a short time to accomplish our tasks. We want the outcomes to match the best aspirations of the community. Your patience, support, voices, and input will be appreciated. You can contact us at [transitiontaskforce@shambhala.org](mailto:transitiontaskforce@shambhala.org)

We are humbled and honored to help Shambhala begin to move forward toward healing and transformation.

Sincerely,

Ani Pema Chödrön, Acharya
