# The Transition Task Force of Shambhala

In brief, our task is two-fold:
 
1. To Select and Appoint an Interim Board to serve for 1 year.  The Interim Board will assume all legal and fiduciary responsibilities previously held by the Kalapa Council for Shambhala USA and Shambhala Canada. Shambhala Europe has a different legal structure, and it is currently in transition from the previous governance structure. 
1. To Select and Appoint a Process Team. Working in tandem with the Interim Board, the Process Team will work with the community to develop an appropriate and healthy governance structure for Shambhala world-wide.

 The selection process will include input and recommendations received from the community.
